“Smart Park” is an affordable system for keeping track of parking lot availability. Sensors placed
around lot entrances and exits update a central server with a running total of open spaces. It is
flexible enough to support different parking lot sensor configurations (such as ultrasonic, RFID,
infrared). The data is made easily available to the users via a website, where they can view the
current availability of parking lot spaces.
